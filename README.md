## A Game for LumberJacks and LumberJackies: You may be a LumberJack , but are you O.K. ?

## Development Stage 1: Minimum Viable Product
### Scope
After the initial consultation with my mentor, it was decided to plan  development in stages.
The first stage aims to fullfill all pass critera for the Code-Institue Portfolio Project 2, and presents the game in its simplest form.  
### Use of Libraries
It was advised, given the ambitious scope of the various develpment stages, and limited time resouce to make full use of libries, eg Bootstrap and JQuery etc.
After consideration it was decided not to use libraries for stage one. The rationale is after feedback from the assesment of Portfolio Project 1 there was room for improvement in UXD, HTML and CSS. It is hoped that this improvement can be made through stage 1 without resorting to the use of libraries. This use of raw HTML CSS and JavaScript can be demonstrated and assesed up to the final commit for Stage 1.

The one exception will be the use of a hamburger menu via bootstrap. Whilst, in Portfolio Project 1, raw code for a hamburger menu was copied (with full accreditation) from an exteral open source web site, this code was heavily modified for use in Portfolio Project 1. It was , however, assesed as being directly derived from bootstrap.
To use the Hamburger code from Portfolio Project 1 in this project would require further heavy modification. A much simpler solution, therefore, would be to use bootstrap, since it appears that this code will be assesed as being from bootstrap in any case.
