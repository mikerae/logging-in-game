# Logging-In
## A Game for LumberJacks and LumberJackies: You may be a LumberJack , but are you O.K. ?

## Development Stage 1: Minimum Viable Product
### Scope
After the initial consultation with my mentor, it was decided to plan  development in stages.
The first stage aims to fullfill all pass critera for the Code-Institue Portfolio Project 2, and presents the game in its simplest form.  
### Use of Libraries
It was advised, given the ambitious scope of the various develpment stages, and limited time resouce to make full use of libries, eg Bootstrap and JQuery etc.
After consideration it was decided not to use libraries for stage 1. The rationale is after feedback from the assesment of Portfolio Project 1 there was room for improvement in UXD, HTML and CSS. It is hoped that this improvement can be made through stage 1 without resorting to the use of libraries. This use of raw HTML CSS and JavaScript can be demonstrated and assesed up to the final commit for Stage 1.

The one exception was the use of a dropdown help menu via bootstrap.

### UXD Resposnive Design
Guidence on building a responsive Grid View was obtained from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_grid.asp).
Code from this site was used to structure the outer wrapper of the page.

For this project it was decided to design from the smallest screen upwards.
Three columns with 15px padding were used for extra small screens:
